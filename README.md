# worldleaders - an encyclopedia of world leaders and governmental systems
 
 This app supplies a list of countries and, when a country is clicked, selects the appropriate document from a database 
 and renders its contents to the path of that country. It shows the relevant heads of state and government (if they exist)
 of the selected country.
 
 future development includes an overhaul of how the information is rendered as well as additional information scraped from
 the internet about the appropriate countries
